# Nyrio

This is customized version of open source Nyrio One robot (https://niryo.com/), but with simplified electronics modules.

The stepper motors controllers were replaced by RAMPS 1.4 + Arduino Mega 2560 board, the Smart servos controllers by OpenCM 9.04 board.

This modules can be used to control any 6DOF robot arm, but initially they were design for Niryo robot.
